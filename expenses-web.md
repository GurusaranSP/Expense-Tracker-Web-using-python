#  Expenses & Savings Tracker — Local Web App (Python + Flask + SQLite)

I'm *Guru Saran Satsangi Peddinti*, and this is my *Local Web-Based Expense & Savings Tracker* — designed to stay private, fast, and fully offline.

Unlike cloud-based trackers that send your personal finance data across servers, this app keeps everything *stored locally inside SQLite*, with a clean and lightweight browser UI powered by Flask.*

Your money.  
Your data.  
Your machine.
